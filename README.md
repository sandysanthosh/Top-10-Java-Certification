Top 10 IT Certifications for Java Developers in 2020
Hello guys, I wish you a very Happy New Year 2020. One of the best things about the New Year is that it encourages and motivates you to achieve. It helps you to look forward and make goals and bring a lot of enthusiasm to you. Many programmers make a goal to learn a new programming language, a new framework, a new library, a new tool, or to get some certifications under the belt to make themselves more valuable. I have shared some of them in updated The 2020 Java Developer RoadMap, just in case if you need some inspiration. Coming back to this article, Recently, I received an email from one of my readers who is asking about which Java certification should he do this year? I asked him back, which Java certifications he has done and how much experience he has in the Java field?

His answer was that he hasn't done any certification yet and working in Java for 2 years now. Like many of us, He was also working as a Java Web Developer using standard web stack like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React on the front end and Spring Boot, Hibernate, and Java on the backend.

Since he hasn't done any certification so far, I suggested him to first start with the OCAJP, Oracle Certified Java Programmer Associate and then go for other Java certification in the hierarchy.

That email also encourages me to write about which certifications Java developer can take in 2020. Well, the answer depends upon your experience, what you are working on, what is your goals, and what other Java certification you have done so far.



 


Top 10 Certifications for Java Programmers
Without further ado, here is my list of top 10 certifications Java developers can take in 2020. The list includes mandatory Java certifications like OCAJP and OCPJP but also certifications on Java related technologies like Spring, Scala, Apache Spark, Docker, Kubernetes, and other essential skills expected from experienced Java programmers like Agile, Scrum, Project Management and Architect level exams.

Top 10 IT Certifications for Java Developers in 2020


The certifications are listed in no particular order, but I recommend Java developers to first pass OCAJP and OCPJP and only then move to other certifications, but that's not a requirement like if you think you are good at Spring, you can go to straight Spring certification, but it looks better in your resume if you have a core Java certifications.


1. Oracle Certified Associate Java Programmer - OCAJP
This is the first certification Java developer should take, also known as OCAJP or just OCA. It's the first of the two exams, you need to take to become an Oracle certified Java professional.

As an application developer, the most critical challenge for us to keep yourself up-to-date, but at the same time, it's not possible for all of us to be up-to-date on every piece of new technology out there, but cloud computing is not one of them.

Cloud-hosting has changed the way all applications are developed from websites to web applications, to mobile apps, and traditional backend applications as well.

The rapid adoption of the cloud has touched everything, and that's why I also recommend Java developers to learn about cloud technologies like Amazon Web Service (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure.
